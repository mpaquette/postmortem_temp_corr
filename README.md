### ISMRM2024 Program 2423

This repo contains a short example of the presented method using invivo data with artificial diffusivity corruption.
The dataset was created from a single b=1000 shell from subject PT001_ses-1_acq-1 from the [Pentera 3T public dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/2602049)
